These methods have become essential in economic analysis (as you have noticed from the reading list for our Ph.D. course on economic growth). For this reason, it is good that you acquaint yourself with these methods. They will prove very useful when doing research, especially to show the spatial distribution of your variables of interest, contructing new measures, or doing spatial analysis."

    "There are various GIS specialized programs and packages. [ESRI](www.esri.com) produces ArcGIS, which is the most known and commonly used commercial software. It is very easy to use to produce maps and do simple computations. Most universities (including ours) offer it in their computer labs. The main disadvantages are that it requires a computer running Windows, it is costly, and extremely slow for computations. Of course this is changing, e.g., now you can use it online.\n",

QGIS can be programmed in Python and many web-based GIS services and databases are programmed in Python. Furthermore, there are many new Python packages which allow you to import, export, analyze, visualize, etc. GIS data. THis notebook will serve as a basic introduction, which I hope to develop further with time. Many of the solutions provded here have been implemented by myself or taken from sources on the web (regretfully I did not keep track from where I took some ideas or snipplets of code, so I cannot provide due credit)."
